Budgeting means tracking income and expenses to avoid overspending.
A 401(k) is a retirement savings plan sponsored by employers.
Emergency funds should cover 3 to 6 months of living costs.
Diversification reduces investment risk.
Credit scores range from 300 to 850 and affect borrowing ability.
Investing Basics:
Diversification helps reduce risk by spreading investments across different asset classes.
Dollar-cost averaging involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of market conditions.
Stocks represent ownership in a company and have the potential for higher returns but come with higher risk.
Bonds are debt securities that pay interest over time and are generally less risky than stocks.
Mutual funds pool money from many investors to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks and/or bonds.
Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) trade like stocks but represent a basket of securities.
Before investing, establish an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.
Assess your risk tolerance to determine an appropriate asset allocation.
Avoid trying to time the market; instead, focus on long-term investing.
Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your target asset allocation.
Understand fees associated with investment products, as they can impact returns.
Tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s can help your investments grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
Investing early and consistently leverages the power of compound interest.
Keep emotions in check; avoid impulsive decisions based on market volatility.
Research and understand investments before committing your money.

Contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs are set by the IRS and can change annually.
Diversify your retirement portfolio to balance growth potential and risk.
Consider your retirement timeline and risk tolerance when choosing investments.
Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) mandate withdrawals from traditional retirement accounts starting at age 73 (subject to change).
Roth IRAs do not have RMDs and allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
Regularly review and adjust your retirement plan as your goals and financial situation change.
Take advantage of catch-up contributions if you are age 50 or older.
Employer matching contributions are essentially free money—contribute enough to get the full match.
Use retirement calculators to estimate how much you need to save.
Understand the difference between taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts.
Social Security benefits can supplement retirement income but usually are not sufficient alone.
Work with a financial advisor to tailor a retirement strategy that fits your needs.
Track your income and all your expenses to understand your spending habits.
Create a monthly budget that accounts for fixed expenses (rent, utilities) and variable expenses (food, entertainment).

Maintain a checking account to manage daily expenses and direct deposits. 
Use online and mobile banking to easily monitor your account balances and transactions.
Set up account alerts to stay informed about low balances, large transactions, or suspicious activity. Use automatic bill pay to avoid late fees and simplify monthly payments. Keep track of your debit and credit card usage to detect fraud early. Protect your personal information by using strong passwords and secure devices when banking online. 
Reconcile your bank statements regularly to catch errors or unauthorized transactions.
Consider linking your savings account to your checking account for overdraft protection. 
Budgeting and Saving Money When You Have Limited Income:

Start by tracking every dollar you earn and spend. Write down your income sources and all expenses, no matter how small. This helps you see where your money is going and identify areas to cut back.
Make a simple monthly budget that covers your essential needs first: housing, utilities, food, transportation, and medical care. Prioritize these before spending on nonessential items.
Set small, realistic savings goals, even if you can only save a few dollars per paycheck. Building a small emergency fund helps protect you from unexpected expenses.
Use free budgeting tools or apps to help organize your finances. Many banks and credit unions offer free tools that categorize spending automatically.
Look for ways to reduce expenses, such as buying generic brands, cooking meals at home, or sharing housing costs with roommates or family.
Consider negotiating with service providers for lower rates on phone, internet, or utilities, especially if you qualify for low-income discounts.
Pay bills on time to avoid late fees and negative credit impacts. If you can’t pay, contact creditors early to ask about hardship programs or payment plans.
Avoid payday loans or other high-cost borrowing, which can lead to a cycle of debt.

Tips for Managing Money When Resources Are Tight:
Focus on meeting basic needs first and avoid taking on new debt if possible.
If you receive assistance benefits, plan carefully to stretch them throughout the month.
Look into free tax preparation services, like Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA), to claim refunds or credits you qualify for.
Consider opening a basic checking or savings account at a bank or credit union that offers low-fee or no-fee accounts.
Stay informed about scams targeting people experiencing hardship. Legitimate help programs will never charge you upfront fees to apply.
Remember, seeking help is a smart financial decision. Many programs exist to support you while you get back on your feet.

Small Business Loans (Based on U.S. Government Resources):
The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) helps small businesses get funding by setting guidelines and guaranteeing portions of loans made by approved lenders. SBA loans are not direct loans from the government to business owners, but rather loans issued by banks and other lenders that follow SBA requirements to reduce risk and improve access to capital.
SBA 7(a) Loan Program:
The SBA 7(a) loan is the most common SBA loan. It can be used for many business purposes, including working capital, equipment, inventory, and buying or improving real estate. Loan amounts can be up to $5 million. Repayment terms vary depending on how funds are used—typically up to 10 years for working capital and up to 25 years for real estate.
SBA 504 Loan Program:
The 504 Loan Program provides long-term, fixed-rate financing for major assets such as land, buildings, or large equipment. These loans are structured with a Certified Development Company (CDC) and a lender. Generally, the borrower provides a 10% down payment, the lender finances 50%, and the CDC finances 40%. This helps businesses get funding with lower down payments and fixed interest rates.
SBA Microloan Program:
The Microloan Program offers smaller loans up to $50,000 to help small businesses and nonprofit childcare centers start up and expand. Microloans are administered through nonprofit community-based lenders. The average microloan amount is about $13,000.
Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL):
EIDL loans provide assistance to small businesses that suffer substantial economic injury due to a declared disaster, such as a natural disaster or public health crisis. These loans can be used to pay operating expenses that could have been met if the disaster had not occurred.
Paycheck Protection Program (PPP):
The PPP was created to help businesses keep employees on payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic. While this program has ended, businesses can still access information and forgiveness applications on the SBA website.
Eligibility:
Eligibility for SBA loans generally requires that the business is for-profit, operates in the U.S., meets SBA size standards, and demonstrates a need for the funds. Owners must also show good character, sound business purpose, and reasonable ability to repay.
Other Government Resources:
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers business loans for rural small businesses through its Business & Industry Loan Guarantee Program.
State and local governments often have small business financing programs, grants, and incentives to promote economic development.
The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) offers resources and connections to financing for minority-owned businesses.
Women-owned businesses can access specialized support through the SBA Office of Women’s Business Ownership.
Veterans can explore SBA’s Veterans Advantage loan programs and other resources tailored to veteran entrepreneurs.
How to Apply:
To apply for an SBA loan, you typically work directly with an SBA-approved lender. You will need to provide a business plan, financial statements, tax returns, collateral information, and details about how you will use the funds. The lender reviews the application, and the SBA guarantees a portion if approved.
