Investing Basics:
Diversification helps reduce risk by spreading investments across different asset classes.
Dollar-cost averaging involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of market conditions.
Stocks represent ownership in a company and have the potential for higher returns but come with higher risk.
Bonds are debt securities that pay interest over time and are generally less risky than stocks.
Mutual funds pool money from many investors to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks and/or bonds.
Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) trade like stocks but represent a basket of securities.
Before investing, establish an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.
Assess your risk tolerance to determine an appropriate asset allocation.
Avoid trying to time the market; instead, focus on long-term investing.
Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your target asset allocation.
Understand fees associated with investment products, as they can impact returns.
